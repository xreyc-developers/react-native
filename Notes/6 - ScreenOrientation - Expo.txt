## EXPO SCREEN ORIENTATION
- after setting the orientation on the App.json, you can still set it on run time
- you can get the type of orientation
- it is better than using Dimension since dimension gets only data from the current size of the screen.
- works only on expo
- if not installed/not working
expo install expo-screen-orientation
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation';

## USAGE ON EXPO
import { ScreenOrientation } from 'expo';

const App = () => {
  // LOCKING THE SCREEN
  ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.PORTRAIT);

  // GET THE CURRENT ORIENTATION
  ScreenOrientation.getOrientationAsync()

  // SET LISTENER
  ScreenOrientation.AddOrientationChangeListener()
}
